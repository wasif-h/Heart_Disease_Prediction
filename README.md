## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can **accurately predict the presence of heart disease** in patients based on various health indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and more.

---

## ðŸ§° Dataset
We use a structured heart disease dataset containing features like:
- Age
- Sex
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Chest Pain Type
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Exercise-Induced Angina
- ST Depression and Slope
- ...and more

---

## ðŸ“Š Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering  
- Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding  
- Standardization using `StandardScaler`  
- Model Building using **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**  
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.  
- Interactive Web App with **Streamlit**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
The final model predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease with good accuracy, enabling preventive actions and early diagnosis.
